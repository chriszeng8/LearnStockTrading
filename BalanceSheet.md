How to Read a Balance Sheet

## Theory

One of the three key statements:
1. Income Statement
2. Cash Flow Statement
3. Balance Sheet

Balance sheet:
* all the assets of the company  - total amount of liability (what the company owe) = equity

Assets have to balance the liabilities and the equity.

**Assets:**

(e.g., personal assets: value of house, car, furniture, ...)
As a company, assets includes: balance of banking account, balance of brokerage account, balance of 401k

**Liabilities:**

(e.g., personal: house loan, car loan, credit loans)
company loans,
mortgages,
deferred revenues

**Equity:**

Difference between Assets and liabilities.

Invest in a company with **growing** equity!!


**Working Capital:**

Current Asset (Cash in the bank) - Current liability (Things to payout this year)

Positive working capital!
*Ideal asset-liability ratio:* **2:1**

**equity growth rate**

balance sheet equity growth rate as No.1 growth rate to figure out future value. True Growth Rate in long run is equity growth rate.

### Assets
#### Current assets
  * **Cash and Cash Equivalents**

   (anything that can be turned into cash *right away*: cash in bank accounts)

  * **Short Term Investments**

  (e.g., a short term CD account, or holding some stocks for a short amount of time)

  * **Net Receivables**

  (anything sold that has not been come in yet, i.e., money that will be paid in the near future. e.g., best buy ordered and received $1,000,000 worth of apple products, and will pay apple at the end of the month. so apple has $1 mill receivable from best buy)

  * **Inventory**

  apple's inventory is low, which is a good sign (efficient handling of shipping and lowered storage cost)

  * **Other Current Assets**
----------------

* **Long Term Investments**

Bond, other companies stock


* **Goodwill**
Branding value (BS category)

* **Intangible Assets**
Patents and Intellectual Properties

* **Amortization**
not that useful

-----------------
### Liabilities
#### Current Liabilities

* **Account Payable**
Bills that the company needs to pay for (inventory orders of apple products to pay to Foxx Conn, electricity bill to pay)

* **Short/Current Long Term Debt**
Debt due within 3 month

* **Other Current Liabilities**

* **Long Term Liabilities**
due in \>3 month, or mostly > 1 year, or even due in much later time

-----------------
### Stockholder's Equity


* **Common Stock**
dividend etc

* **Preferred Stock**
  * provide added layer or protection; preferred dividend will be paid before common dividend
  * no voting stock
  * more similar to bond


### Key things to look at:
* A: Cash and Cash Equivalent


* B: (Short Term Investments + Long Term Investments) - (Short Term debt + Long Term debt)

If B/A ratio ~ 3/1 or 4/1, great thing!

If less than that, risky!
